Snake
=====

An implementation of the snake game as part of the CIS220 course for the University of London

Over the course of several weeks code that implements features covered in class will be added. Hopefully we will have a working snake game before the end of the course.

The objective is to focus on the object oriented design rather than on the graphics.

See this [course page](http://vincentramdhanie.com/posts/cis220/) for details of the course.
